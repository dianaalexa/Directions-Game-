### 1. Game Map ###

# Create a set of instructions helping the player find their way through a game,
# by replicating the map provided in the course. Depending on where the player
# is currently located, the program first describes the current location and then
# reveals the directions in which the player can move further. The possible directions
# should be expressed in geographical coordinates (N, S, E, W) + Q (the option to quit the
# game is always available). The starting position is the Road.

# Tip: - store the locations along with their position numbers in a dictionary 
#      - store the possible exists for each location in a list of dictionaries ;-)
